# Changelog

## [0.3.0]

### 🚀 Major Changes
- **Monorepo Split**: Restructured from a single package into a multi-package workspace using `uv` workspaces.
  - `libs/mageflow` — Core task orchestration engine
  - `libs/third-magic` (`thirdmagic`) — Shared models, signatures, and task definitions
  - `libs/mage-voyance` — Visualizer (extracted from `mageflow/visualizer`)
- **Client Adapter Pattern**: We changed the design to be ready for future support of additional task managers (like temporal). We extracted the hatchet unique code to client module, there we handle all the hatchet code 

### 🔄 Changed
- **BREAKING — Package Imports**: All imports changed due to the split. Core orchestration from `mageflow`, shared models from `thirdmagic`.
- **Swarm Task Calling**: All swarm tasks will be called from `fill_running_tasks` workflow. This is an inner task of mageflow, it is a gateway for publishing new tasks.
- **Task Lock Responsibility**: Lock management moved from `fill_running_tasks` to the task client layer.
- **Hatchet SDK Requirement**: Now requires `hatchet-sdk>=1.22.5`.

### 🛠️ Technical Improvements
- **Per-package CI coverage**: Coverage pipeline reports per-package results with tags.
- **Publish pipeline for thirdmagic**: CI can now publish the `thirdmagic` package independently.


## [0.2.0]

### 🏗️ Design Changes
- **Nested Tasks Redesign**: We change how nested task (like task in a chain) alert the parent task on status change. This will help save a lot of memory in redis and have faster execution. For that we added:
  - **Container sub-task hooks**: `on_sub_task_done()` and `on_sub_task_error()` abstract methods on `ContainerTaskSignature` for handling child task lifecycle events.
  - **BREAKING** - Removed `task_identifiers` from `TaskSignature`: Replaced by `signature_container_id` for parent reference.

### ✨ Added
- **`aio_run_in_swarm()` method**: Add and schedule a task in a running swarm in a single call, replacing the previous `add_task()` + `aio_run_no_wait()` two-step pattern.
- **Chain kwargs forwarding**: Chains now accept `**kwargs` that are forwarded to all sub-tasks during execution.

### 🔄 Changed
- **BREAKING** - Removed `BatchItemTaskSignature`: Swarm tasks are no longer wrapped in batch item signatures. Tasks run directly within the swarm.
- **BREAKING** - Removed `add_task()` from swarm: Use `aio_run_in_swarm()` instead.
- **BREAKING** - Removed `add_callbacks()` from `TaskSignature`: Callbacks are now set at creation time only.
- **All internal tasks are durable**: Chain and swarm infrastructure tasks now use `durable_task` for crash recovery.

### 🛠️ Technical Improvements
- **Task data parameter consolidation**: Only `task_id` is sent as task metadata instead of a full `task_data` dictionary. This will allow users to filter workflow base on task id and will save data that is sent in tasks.

### 🧪 Tests
- **Unit tests for handle decorator**: Added comprehensive tests for `handle_task_callback` decorator.
- **Unit tests for signature creation**: Added tests for `TaskSignatureOptions` and `resolve_signature_key`.


## [0.1.1]

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Native workflow execution**: Fixed some bugs that prevented running tasks natively (no mageflow support)


## [0.1.0]

### ✨ Added
- **Signature TTL**: Time-To-Live set to 1 day for automatic expiration

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Idempotent Swarm Tasks**: Swarm task execution is now idempotent, preventing duplicate execution on retries or crash recovery
  - Tasks track publishing state to avoid re-publishing already-running tasks
  - `fill_running_tasks` workflow handles task distribution atomically
- **Idempotent Chain Workflows**: Chain workflows now support crash recovery with idempotent task transitions


## [0.0.4]
### ✨ Added
- `stagger_execution` decorator for deadlock prevention through random task staggering
- `close_on_max_task` flag in `add_task` method - automatically closes task when maximum number of tasks (from config) is reached (can be disabled by setting flag to False)

### 🐛 Fixed
- Support Hatchet retries with signature
- Error callbacks now wait until all retries are completed or stopped before activation


## [0.0.3]
Fixed a bug for running chain in swarms


## [0.0.2]
Stability - Limit version for rapyer


## [0.0.1]
First release
